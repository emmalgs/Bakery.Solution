## Description

Welcome to Pierre's Bakery! Order your favorites from our bread or pastry menu, watch our sweet Pierre work his magic and make your order fresh! You can always shop for more baked goods or checkout when you're finished. This is a C# program that runs in your console.

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* Microsoft Tests

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g. Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's directory called "Bakery".
3. To compile and execute the console app, in the command line in the directory "Bakery", run:

4. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.
